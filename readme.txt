To implement face recognition-based duplicate checking, where the system throws an error if the user is trying to register with a face already in the database, here's a roadmap of how you can approach this problem:

Roadmap for Duplicate Face Detection in Registration:
1. Store Faces in a Usable Format
Current Situation: You already store user images as base64-encoded strings in the database.
Next Step: You’ll need to store facial features or face encodings, which are numeric representations of a face, instead of storing only raw images. These encodings can be compared to detect if two faces are the same.
Action: During registration, after capturing and uploading the image, use a face recognition library to generate a face encoding (numerical representation of the face).

Libraries: You can use Python's face_recognition library for generating and comparing face encodings. It’s built on top of dlib, which uses machine learning algorithms to recognize faces.
2. Generate Face Encodings
When a user submits their registration form with the image, the backend should:
Decode the base64 image.
Pass the image to a face recognition library.
Generate the face encoding (numerical representation of the face).
